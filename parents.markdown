## Activities

Sierra High offers several activities for students to enhance their skills. The Leadership Class is responsible for assisting student advisors in setting up school activities. Applications may be turned in to the advisors in early September. The Yearbook Class prepares the annual yearbook for the school.

## Attendance

Sierra students are required to be on time daily, and to remain for the full day. Since most students are behind in credits, regular attendance becomes very important in order to make up lost credits. Illness, medical appointments and the funeral of an immediate family member are the only reasons for excused absence.

## Dress Code

Students who do not dress in uniform must follow the district guidelines. The following items are not permitted for school attire:

1.  Clothing that indicates an affiliation with a gang or intimidating group
2.  Caps, hats, bandannas, hairnets or visors
3.  Oversized pants that fall below the waist
4.  Baggy shorts with knee socks
5.  Belts with lettering or longer than waist appropriate
6.  Halter tops, tank tops, bare midriffs, see-through or fish net clothing
7.  Clothing that does not conceal undergarments at all times
8.  Skirts or shorts shorter than mid-thigh
9.  Clothing that suggests obscene pictures, wording, and/or drugs, alcohol, smoking, sex or violence
10.  Frayed or unfinished hems
11.  Thongs, thong-like sandals, steel-toed shoes or sandals without a back strap
