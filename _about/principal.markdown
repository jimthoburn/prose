I am honored and excited to be serving as Principal of Sierra High School.  Sierra High School serves the needs of our students by offering proven and effective alternative programs including: a six-period day for continuation high school students, The Underdog Mural program, a competitive sports league, and  the Student Opportunity for Academic Recovery program (S.O.A.R.).  We are proud of our diverse programs and commitment to preparing students for work or college.  Our highest priorities are to improve reading, writing, and mathematics skills.  Please feel free to [email me](mailto:phernandez@azusa.org) or stop by at your convenience.
