Congratulations to Sierra High School's Violet Vargas for her Third Place Finish in The [Rotary Clubâ€™s](https://www.rotary.org/myrotary/en/learning-reference/about-rotary/guiding-principles) speech contest.  Contestants gave a 6 to 8 minute speech that connected the Rotary's Four Way Test to a personal experience.  The Four Way Test: Is it the Truth,  Is it fair to all concerned,  Will it build good will and better friendships, and  Will it be beneficial to all concerned, is part of the ethical guide used by Rotarians. Congratulations again to Violet Vargas and all of the other AUSD students that participated in the contest.
