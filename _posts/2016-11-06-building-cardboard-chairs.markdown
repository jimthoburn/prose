GATE students in Mrs. Stricklin's Exploring Art class created cardboard chairs and benches that could hold 150-200 pounds.  A contest was held at lunch time to determine the winner.  The judging criteria was visual appeal and overall strength.  Chair #3, with the word "bench" on it, was the winner.  The designers and creators won an In-n-Out lunch as a reward.
