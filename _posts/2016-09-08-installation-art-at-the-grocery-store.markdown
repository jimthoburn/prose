Sierra High School artists visited Albertson’s Market in Glendora.  The students created two Installation Art pieces using what they've learned in class to beautify the community!  Students transformed an 8' diameter circular table into a vibrant color wheel  using vegetables from the produce section.  Another group of students created a Monet study of his wife, “Study of Woman with Parasol”, using cereal, rice and chips to replicate the beautiful Impressionist painting. Friends and community members stopped by to watch students work, and it was fun for everyone involved.
