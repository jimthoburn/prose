    <h1>About Our School</h1>

    <div class="text">
      <p>Sierra High School is a fully accredited California Model Continuation High School serving students 16 years of age and older. Although some students are placed at Sierra for disciplinary reasons, most are placed because they are behind in credits and need specialized attention within an alternative educational environment.  Students may also choose Sierra as an alternative to attending a comprehensive high school.  Sierra High School is on a trimester system which allows students to enroll in up to six courses each session.  Students may earn up to 90 credits per year, giving them an increased opportunity to earn the 220 credits required for a high school diploma.  In addition to full time enrollment at Sierra, students may earn additional credits through the Regional Occupational Program (ROP) and through the Azusa Adult School.</p>

      <p>Central to the school’s philosophy is the belief that provided a personalized, caring, and enriched environment students will develop to their fullest potential.  The ultimate goal of Sierra High School is to develop a person who is willing to accept and display the responsibilities of good citizenship and to perform satisfactorily as a contributing member of our society.</p>
